# Launch School: Introduction to Programming with Ruby

### TL;DR

- Complete the exercises in <a href="https://launchschool.com/books/ruby">"Introduction to Programming with Ruby"</a>
- Push your code for the exercises to a Github repo
- One git repo for all exercises in the book
- Create a folder for each chapter in the book
- Create a separate file for every exercise in the chapter

### Instructions

Now that you've got a little exposure to Ruby, it's time to take the next step. **Read and complete the exercises in <a href="https://launchschool.com/books/ruby">"Introduction to Programming with Ruby"</a>.** Be sure that you've mastered the basic Ruby syntax and grammar that we cover in this book: mastery is crucial as you move forward.

Reading this book and doing the exercises is mandatory. If you have significant prior programming experience, you may be able to move through it quickly, but take the time to do so. If you don't read this book, you may not be able to progress in the Core Curriculum, or may have to turn to other sources for the same information.

**You should push your code for the exercises to a Github repository.** (Refer to the <a href="https://launchschool.com/books/git">Introduction to Git and Github</a> book that you read in the previous course if you need a reminder on how to use Git.) Make sure you use a new git repository—don't mix code for the book's exercises with any other code. See below for information about organizing your code and why we want you to use a Github repository.

We need you to code—not just read—through the entire book. If you can't complete the exercises in the book, you will struggle later on when things get much more complicated.

Spend as much time as you need to go through this book carefully. It's the most important part of the prep course. It's vital that you're comfortable reading and writing basic Ruby syntax, and understand fundamental programming constructs such as loops, variables, and conditionals.

### Organizing Your Code on Github

We suggest that you organize your solutions this way:

- Use one git repository for all exercises in the Ruby book. (Remember: don't nest git repositories.)
- Create a folder within that repository for each chapter in the book.
- Create a separate file for every exercise in the chapter.

You don't have to do things this way, but it's an organization that works well for most students. We don't always look at your code, so you'll mostly be doing this for yourself. However, we may look at your code if you seem to be struggling; we'll look at your previous code to see what you've done in the past. If we don't see much code or if it's disorganized and hard to find, we may conclude that you're not prepared for the course.
