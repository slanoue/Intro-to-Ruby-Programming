# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

puts "Exception handling is a way to make sure your program doesn't completely grind to a halt if it runs into an error. In areas where you know you might get unexpected user input that could product errors, exception handling is a great way to tell your program what to fall back on in case it runs into one of those errors."
